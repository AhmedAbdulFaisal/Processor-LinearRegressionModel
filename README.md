# ProcessorModel
This is my CS301 (Intro to Data Structures) project which predicts the processor speed (in GHz) based off of three features: The TDP, Lithography, and # of threads. Despite the model being quite primitive (with a somewhat dissapointing R2 score), it is a showcase example of what Linear Regression can be used for. In the future I intend to use this on a dataset with older processor models.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/intel-processors?select=intel_processors_v1_6.csv

The datasets were parsed through pandas on a local machine. In order to get working examples you must use the same .csv files in the root folder of the project.
